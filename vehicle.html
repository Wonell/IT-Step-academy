            <h1>Vehicle</h1>
        <section>
                    <p>A vehicle (from Latin: vehiculum<sup>[1]</sup>) is a machine that transport people or cargo. Vehicles include wagons,
                        bicycles, motor vehicles (motorcycles, cars, trucks, buses), railed vehicles (trains, trams), watercraft (ships,
                        boats), amphibious vehicles (screw-propelled vehicle, hovercraft), aircraft (airplanes, helicopters) and
                        spaceccraft.<sup>[2]</sup></p>
                
                         
                    <p>Land vehicles are classified broadly by what is used to apply steering and drive forces against the ground:
                        wheeled, tracked, railed or skied. ISO 3833-1977 is the standard, also internationally used in legislation, for
                        road vehicles types, terms and definitions.<sup>[3]</sup></p>
