        <h2>Linear Equations</h2>

        <span>A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form</span>
    
        <p> <span class="vzorec">ax + b = 0 </span></p>
    
        where a and b are real numbers and x is a variable. This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear
        equation. Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may or may not be an x
        so don't get too locked into always seeing an x there.
    
        <h2>Quadratic Equation</h2>
    
        The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:
    
        <p> <span class="vzorec">ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0 </span></p>
    
        where a, b, c are known values and x is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, a can't be 0.
    
        <h3>The area fof a circle (A) </h3>
    
        &pi; (Pi) times the radius (r) squared:
    
        <p> <span class="vzorec">A = &pi; x r<sup>2</sup></span></p>
    
        or, when you know the diameter (D):
    
       <p> <span class="vzorec">A = (&pi; / 4 ) x D<sup>2</sup></span></p>
    
        or, when you know the circumference (C):
    
        <p> <span class="vzorec"> A = C<sup>2</sup>/ 4 x &pi;</span></p>
        
       
        <h3>Intersection</h3>
    
        the Intersection of two sets A and B, denoted by A &cap; B, is the set of all objects that are memvers of both the sets
        A and B. In symbols,
    
        A &cap; B = { x : x } /*tady je třeba dát znak je prvkem množinky*/
    
        This is, x is an element of the intersection A &scap; B if and only if s is both an element of A and an element of B
